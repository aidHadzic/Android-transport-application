# Android-transport-application
Android App + Firebase things

<p>Application is written in Android Studio and it is done in scrum by my three coleagues and me in limited time and other resources. It is called BRoutes which stands for "Bosnia Routes". The idea for application came because of the need for such an application. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we do not have an application like 9292 in Netherlands. We tried to do something about it but with the lowest possible amount of resources. We used Trello for assigning tasks to group members and github for code exchange. We used Firebase as database.</p>

<p>On the starting screen is shown the "Advertisements" tab where traveling agencies from Bosnia and Herzegovina can put their adverts. User can see the rating and the description of particular advert.</p>
<p>Next tab is called "Departures". User is selecting one city from the dropdown list of cities, hit the "search" button, and there are displayed all deparatures from picked city to other cities, together with starting and ending times. If user clicks on one of results, "Map" tab is opened, and route between two cities is sketched using Google Map, together with all stopovers or the places where bus stops between two cities.<p>
<p>Right from the "Departures" is placed "Schedule" tab where user can select two cities from the drowdown lists as the starting and final destinations. Then hit the "search" button, and departures from starting to final destination with times of starting and arriving are shown on the screen. Again, if user clicks to one of results, "Map" tab is opened and the route is sketched with all stopovers.</p>
